About

This project is a multi-agent AI research and content generation system built using CrewAI and Google Gemini.

The system orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents—each with distinct roles, memory, and tools—to collaboratively research emerging topics and produce high-quality written content. A Senior Researcher agent investigates cutting-edge trends, evaluates opportunities and risks, and synthesizes insights, while a Writer agent transforms the research into an engaging, human-readable article.

By leveraging Gemini 2.5 Flash as the underlying LLM and Serper (Google Search) tools for real-time information retrieval, the project demonstrates how autonomous AI agents can work together in a structured workflow to perform complex knowledge tasks end-to-end.

Key features include:

Multi-agent collaboration using CrewAI

Role-based agents with memory and delegation

Research and writing task separation

Real-time web search using Serper API

High-performance reasoning using Google Gemini

Sequential task execution with structured outputs

Automatic article generation in Markdown format

This project showcases advanced concepts in agentic AI systems, autonomous workflows, and AI-assisted research, making it an excellent example for AI engineering portfolios, applied LLM systems, and intelligent automation solutions.
